User Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. User stories are short, simple description of a feature told from the
   perspective of the person who desires the new capability. This is
   usually a user or customer of the system.

#. Template: *As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.*

#. Often written on index cards, sticky notes and placed in a shoe box,
   arranged on walls, tables, to facilitate planning and discussion.

#. Focus shifts from writing about features to discussing them.

#. User stories can be written at varying levels of detail. Thus, user
   stories can be written to cover large amounts of functionality. These
   are generally known as *epics*. An example:

       *As a user, I can backup my entire drive*
